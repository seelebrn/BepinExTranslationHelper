# BepinExTranslationHelper
A small block of code allowing instant refresh of translations. To be used in the following case : 

1) You're translating a game (or want to see text values changed instantly, whatever your reasons are)
2) You're somehow using BepinEx
3) You're able to convert your translations files (or the file containing the text you want to change, if it's not a translation) into a dict (here, translationdict)

If you like this and want to show appreciation, you could always buy me a ko-fi (https://ko-fi.com/cadenzabrn), but you don't have to and I like you nevertheless <3
