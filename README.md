# BepinExTranslationHelper
A small block of code allowing instant refresh of translations. To be used in the following case : 

1) You're translating a game (or want to see text values changed instantly, whatever your reasons are)
2) You're somehow using BepinEx
3) You're able to convert your translations files into a dict (here, translationdict)

If you like this and want to show appreciation, you could always buy me a ko-fi (Ko-fi.com), but you don't have to and I like you nevertheless <3
