# BepinExTranslationHelper
A small block of code allowing instant refresh of translations. To be used in the following case : 

1) You're translating a game (or want to see text values changed instantly, whatever your reasons are)
2) You're somehow using BepinEx
3) You're able to convert your translations files into a dict (here, translationdict)
